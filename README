glox is an implementation of lox in Go.

Major difference compare to clox:
  - Go has a gc, hence all memory related stuffs are gone.
  - Go has no pointer arithmetic, hence need to use index.
  - Go does not have enum, so constants no type information.
  - Go does not have inline, so define anonymous function in
    function scope.
  - Go does not have explicit conditional compilation, so at
    compiler discretion.
