glox is an implementation of the lox compiler in Go, and is based
on the clox compiler written in C (clox).

lox is the creation of Robert Nystrom (craftinginterpreters.com).

Major difference compare to clox:
  - Go has a gc, hence all memory related stuffs are gone.
  - Go has no pointer arithmetic, hence need to use index.
  - Go does not have enum, hence use const and type.
  - Go does not have inline, so define anonymous function in
    function scope.
  - Go does not have explicit conditional compilation, so at
    compiler discretion.

Pratt Parser

In the C code, use forward declaration to handle a declaration cycle
in the Pratt Parser.  In Go, use an init() to fix the invalid
initialization cycle.
